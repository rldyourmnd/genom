## Conclusions

1. Both sequences have similar transcription factor distribution patterns, with ETS factors predominating.
2. ATF2500 has a significantly higher density of binding sites for GC-box and SP1, which may indicate a higher GC content in the promoter.
3. ATF3 has a more diverse set of transcription factors, including CRE and AP-1 sites, which are absent in ATF2500.
4. Despite differences in length, both sequences have similar factor distribution patterns, indicating potentially similar regulatory mechanisms.
5. For a more detailed understanding of the functional differences between these sequences, experimental validation of the detected binding sites is recommended.
